Feature: As Charlie
  In order to have an issue discussed in parliament
  I want to be able to create a petition and verify my email address.

Scenario: Charlie has to search for a petition before creating one
  Given the following petitions exist:

    | Rioters should loose benefits  | open     |             835 | 2011-08-11 |
    | Rioters must loose benefits    | rejected |               5 |            |
    | Do not remove rioters benefits | open     |            1023 | 2011-08-21 |
  And I am on the home page
  When I follow "Start a petition" within ".//main"
  Then I should be asked to search for a new petition
  When I check for similar petitions
  Then I should see the following similar petitions:
    | Do not remove rioters benefits | 1,023 signatures |
    | Rioters should loose benefits  | 835 signatures   |
  When I choose to create a petition anyway
